/*
#TODO/TAI: Create an interface for handling a .bib file belonging to the vault.
- This can be just a local .bib, but it will have additional properties
- For instance, you should be able to create an entry from a doi
    - Maybe this is not advisible, it is better to force peaple to use zotero
        - yes, do not duplicate perfectly fine software
        - with the non-local doi extraction tools you can enhance zotero all you want
- Maybe this is a dumb idea
