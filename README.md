## Oba plugin

Just add a command which will update a trigger file `backend-signal.json` at the plugin dir.
This is intended as a primitive source of comunication with the backends so they run the scripts at the vault.

### Install
`git clone` this repo, `cd` into it, and run:

```bash
npm i; node install-plugin.js path/to/vault
```
