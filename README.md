## Oba plugin

My personal set of tools for Obsidian. 
No documentation is provided as I'm the only user at the moment :(


### Current "usable" tools

#### Handle papers notes

- Interact with `.bib` files for dealing with personal citations.
- Interact with crossref for accessing further papers references.
- tooling for easily adding reference links in papers notes.

#### Integration with vscode

- Jump to cursor position from Obsidian to vscode.

#### git integration

- Commit vault to a target branch.
- Checkout note to last committed version.

### Install
`git clone` this repo, `cd` into it, and run:

```bash
npm i; node install-plugin.js path/to/vault
```

### TODOs

[ ] Add documentation
